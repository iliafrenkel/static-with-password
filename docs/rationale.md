# Rationale

How do you make a static website? You use one of the many static site
generators to produce a bunch of html/css/js files. You put the files
behind some web server, Apache and Nginx springs to mind, but it can
be anything. And you have yourself a website.

Now, what if you wanted to make the website a little bit more private?
So that only a few people could see it? This is where this little utility
comes in!
